            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist renowned for developing the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics). His equation \(E = mc^2\), which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy, is one of the most famous formulas in science.
                <br><br>
                Born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, Einstein made significant contributions to the understanding of space, time, and energy. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which was crucial in establishing quantum theory.
                <br><br>
                Einstein was also known for his advocacy of pacifism, his support for civil rights, and his involvement in various social and political causes. He spent the later part of his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he continued to work on unifying physical theories until his death in 1955.

            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein made groundbreaking contributions to physics, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe. His theory of relativity, which includes both special and general relativity, transformed concepts of space, time, and gravity. The famous equation \(E = mc^2\) illustrates the equivalence of mass and energy. In 1905, Einstein also explained the photoelectric effect, which supported quantum theory and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. His work on Brownian motion provided crucial evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules.

                Einstein’s field equations, part of his general theory of relativity, describe how matter and energy influence the curvature of spacetime. These equations have been foundational in modern cosmology and our understanding of phenomena such as black holes and the expansion of the universe. Although he later rejected his cosmological constant, initially introduced to account for a static universe, it has become significant in explaining dark energy in contemporary cosmology.
                <br><br>
                Despite his initial skepticism of quantum mechanics, Einstein’s ideas, particularly on quantum entanglement, have significantly influenced the development of quantum theory. His later efforts to develop a unified field theory aimed to reconcile general relativity with electromagnetism, laying important groundwork for future research. Beyond his scientific achievements, Einstein’s advocacy for education, civil rights, and humanitarian causes has had a lasting impact on society.
